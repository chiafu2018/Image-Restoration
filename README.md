Student ID: 110550124

## Introduction 
The primary objective of this assignment is to use the PromptIR model to restore degraded images. The dataset includes images affected by rain and snow, where you are required to remove rainstreaks and snowflakes to recover the original image content. The dataset consists of 1,600 rainy images and 1,600 snowy images, each paired with its corresponding clean (ground truth) image.    

Please refer to the [PromptIR GitHub repository](https://github.com/va1shn9v/PromptIR) for detailed instructions on how to execute the program, including how to run the model and set up the required environment.
